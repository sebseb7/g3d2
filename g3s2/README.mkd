g3s2
============

groesser gruener grafik SDL simulator

using this software an an FTDI you can use a PC to simulate the g3d2

for example you can connect an LPC board running tetrisVI (wich usually displays it content on the the g3d2) and use the g3s2 as the display hardware.
So you test your LPC Code without having a g3d2 acound.

PS: only tested under MAC OSX (designed to work on Linux too)


this is what is looks like:
